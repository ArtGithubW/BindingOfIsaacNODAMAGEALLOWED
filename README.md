# BindingOfIsaacNODAMAGEALLOWED

Ever wondered why you are horrid at binding of isaac? Its simply because there are no physical stakes to doing bad(Taking dmg) in the video game and there is no incentive to get better. Positive reinforcement is proven to be less effective than raw unfiltered physical pain. This is where this repo comes in handy.
